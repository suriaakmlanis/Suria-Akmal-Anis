	<p style="font-family: monospace;color: saddlebrown;text-align: justify;font-size: 20px;">In my first semester entering university, my first experience is when i am joining <b>Student Representative Council</b>. I've learn a lot from my senior to handle a program, from the simple one to the biggest event joining by the Rector and other Vips. Other than that, i learn how to overcome various problems voiced by students in the campus. Student Representative Council has opened my eyes to the weight of responsibility as a leader to protect and meet all the needs of the people under me. When i am entering my second semester i quit the council and start focusing on my training in <b>SISPA</b>.</p>

	<p style="font-family: monospace;color: saddlebrown;text-align: justify;font-size: 20px;">I stay in SISPA for 2 years and half for rescue and medical training. I really gained a lot of experience and knowledge in SISPA untill last october, me and my fellow team was commisioned the rank of <b>Young Lieutenant by Angkata Pertahanan Awam (APM)</b>. It is such an honor to be an officer in such a young age and got the chance to teach the next generation about APM.</p>
